# FINM325 Assignment 1: CSV-Based Algorithmic Trading Backtester

## Authors: Simon Guo, Lin Fang, Roxxane Wang, Victor Ji

## Goals of this Project
In this project, we built a simple CSV-Based Algorithmic trading backtester, with simulated stock data generated for Apple (ticker symbol: AAPL). We processed the simulated stock price, and applied two popular trading strategies, including the moving average crossover and momentum trading to simulate the investment returns. Last, we analyzed the performance of these two trading strategies.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Create and activate the environment for this backtester:
```bash
conda create -n finm python=3.13.5
conda activate finm
```

2. Install package dependencies
```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib ipykernal
```

3. Cloning for your use
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linnnFang/FINM325_assignment1
cd FINM325_assignment1
```
